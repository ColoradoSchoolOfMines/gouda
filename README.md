# gouda
A new web software for Mines ACM sites.

## Roadmap
This site will be developed after the completion of our ACM pages project.

Future needs for this project:
- Headcount functionality for upcoming meetings
- GitHub webhook with Mines servers for auto-updates
- Dockerizing the application
- Consider other clubs' needs (especially with UI design and making things unique)
